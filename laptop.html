                    <p>Here are ten quick and easy steps that you can take to increase the security of your laptop. To make things easy, I've summarized these steps in an infographic! I also broke this post down into the following three sections so you can
                        focus on what matters to you most: </p>
                    <p> <b>Essentials steps: </b><span>This section groups together the four steps everyone should perform to ensure that their laptop is keeping their data safe. </span> </p>
                    <p><b>Protect your privacy:</b><span> This section lists the steps you can take to enhance your laptop privacy protection. </span></p>
                    <p class="h3">Essential steps</p>
                    <p> The following are four steps everyone should perform to ensure that their laptop can keep their data safe.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Use a password when logging in </p>
                    <p> The most important step for securing your laptop and preventing other people from accessing your files without permission is to require a login password. Make sure to create a password that is difficult to guess, so don't use your
                        birthday, your cat's name, or the name of a loved one. Here is how to automatically disable the login on start on macOS.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Use a password-protected screensaver </p>
                    <p>To ensure that people can't swoop in and snoop if you've left your laptop unattended for a few minutes, make sure that the screensaver starts automatically and requires a password to exit. Here is how to do this on a macOS and a Windows
                        PC.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold"> Encrypt your hard drive</p>
                    <p> Protecting your laptop with a password is not enough to prevent an attacker from accessing your files. If your laptop is stolen or the attacker has a lot of time, he can remove the hard drive and read the files directly. To prevent
                        this and to protect your data from physical attacks, encrypt your laptop's hard drive. Here is how to do this on a macOS and a Windows PC. If you want to go even further, consider adding a second factor to your disk encryption.
                        It's not something I personally do, but a few friends have had success with it on Linux.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Backup your data </p>
                    <p>From ransomware attacks to stolen laptops, backing up your data is essential to ensuring you will not lose what you hold dear. You can go with either a local backup or a cloud backup. On macOS, Apple offers the Time Machine feature
                        that can be used for local backups (don't forget to encrypt your backup!). On Windows, you can use the backup utility Microsoft provides or a more user-friendly application, such as the popular EaseUS Todo Backup. For remote backups,
                        every major cloud service (Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon Drive , Backblaze) provides its own tool. If you want backup software that encrypts the backup before sending it to your favorite cloud service so that it can't read it,
                        then I recommend the on I use: Arq.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Keep your system and software up to date </p>
                    <p>The best way to keep your laptop malware-free is to not download random things (e.g., a weird Flash update) and to keep your software up to date. Modern browsers such as Chrome and Firefox have auto-update enabled by default, but you
                        still need to restart them from time to time. Make sure to turn on auto-update for your operating system and apps to benefits from the latest security patches (here is how to do it for macOS, Windows 10 by default do it).
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold h3">Protect your privacy
                    </p>
                    <p>Here are three additional steps you can take to increase your privacy. </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">Add a privacy screen</p>
                    <p> Shoulder surfing attacks are more common that you would think. Humans are curious by nature and will naturally glance at your screen whether you're at a coffee shop, the library, or on a plane. To prevent shoulder surfing attacks and
                        increase your privacy, add a privacy screen that limits the viewing angles. <br> Over the years, I have tested quite a few models, and overall I think the 3M Gold Privacy Filter is the one that is best at restricting viewing angles
                        while retaining the luminosity needed for looking at the screen.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold"> Add a webcam cover </p>
                    <p>There is probably nothing worse for privacy than a RAT (Remote Administration Tool), like the infamous DarkComet, which turns on your camera to spy on you. While in theory the LED next to your camera should always be on when the camera
                        is on, in practice hackers have found a way to disable it both on Windows and MacOS. The only bulletproof option to keeping voyeurs at bay is to add a physical cover on top of the camera that you can remove as necessary. I've tested
                        many covers over the years, and the one that I like best, due to its quality and compactness, is the Spyslide one that was funded on Indiegogo. It fits perfectly on my MacBook I am considering putting one on my iPad and phone as
                        well.
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold"> Use a virtual private network </p>
                    <p> To protect your privacy while using public Wi-Fi and prevent your internet provider from tracking your browser history, use a VPN service (virtual private network). The VPN encrypts the traffic between you and the VPN server, making
                        it impossible for people on the same network to track what you are doing. Because the VPN provider can track what you are doing, it is important to choose one that has a good privacy policy, which is why I recommend this article
                        by TorrentFreak to help you choose.
